			/* SARL is a general-purpose agent-oriented language.
			 * 
			 * SARL aims at providing the fundamental abstractions 
			 * for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, 
			 * decentralization, reactivity, autonomy and dynamic 
			 * reconfiguration. These high-level features are now 
			 * considered the major requirements for an easy and 
			 * practical implementation of modern complex software 
			 * applications. We are convinced that the agent-oriented 
			 * paradigm holds the keys to effectively meet this challenge.
			 * 
			 * Considering the variety of existing approaches and 
			 * meta-models in the field of agent-oriented engineering 
			 * and more generally multi-agent systems, our approach 
			 * remains as generic as possible and highly extensible 
			 * to easily integrate new concepts and features.
			 * 
			 * __The language is platform- and architecture-independent.__

			 * SARL may be used for agent based applications. 
			 * Natively, SARL provides features for agent execution and 
			 * direct communication. The agents may be deployed
			 * on real computers and over a computer network.

			 * The SARL developers are providing the definition
			 * of an organizational space based on the
			 * [CRIO meta-model](http://www.aspecs.org/CRIO)
			 * (Capacity-Role-Interaction-Organization) for example.
			 * This meta-model defines a system as a set of organizations 
			 * in which roles are defined and interacting together. 
			 * Agents play roles in organization instances (or groups)

			 * [Xbase partial programming language](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Xbase),
