			/* Janus is an open-source multi-agent platform fully implemented 
			 * in Java 1.7. Janus enables developers to quickly create 
			 * web, enterprise and desktop multiagent-based applications.
			 *  
			 * It provides a comprehensive set of features to develop, 
			 * run, display and monitor multiagent-based applications.
			 *  
			 * Janus-based applications can be distributed across a network. 
			 * Janus could be used as an agent-oriented platform, an 
			 * organizational platform, and/or an holonic platform. It 
			 * also natively manages the concept of recursive agents and 
			 * holons.

			 * __Janus is a platform not a language.__
