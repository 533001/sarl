/**
 * This document describes how to define capacities in SARL.
 * Before reading this document, it is recommended to read
 * the [General Syntax Reference](./GeneralSyntaxReferenceSpec.html).
 * 
 * An Action is a specification of a transformation of a part of the 
 * designed system or its environment. This transformation guarantees 
 * resulting properties if the system before the transformation satisfies 
 * a set of constraints. An action is defined in terms of pre- and post-conditions.
 * 
 * A *Capacity* is the specification of a collection of actions. This specification 
 * makes no assumptions about its implementation. It could be used to specify 
 * what an agent can do, what a behavior requires for its execution.
 * 
 * A *Skill* is a possible implementation of a capacity fulfilling all the 
 * constraints of this specification.
 * 
 * An agent can dynamically evolve by learning/acquiring new Capacities, but it 
 * can also dynamically change the Skill associated to a given capacity.
 * Acquiring new capacities also enables an agent to get access to new 
 * behaviors requiring these capacities. This provides agents with a self-adaptation 
 * mechanism that allow them to dynamically change their architecture according to 
 * their current needs and goals.
