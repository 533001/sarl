/**
 * @outline
 *
 * SARL enables to declare objects with an object-oriented programming approach.
 * This document describes the basic support of object-oriented programming provided by SARL.
 * Before reading this document, it is recommended reading
 * the [General Syntax Reference](./GeneralSyntaxReferenceSpec.html).
 * 
 * The support of the object-oriented programming (OOP) statements in SARL is less complete
 * than a real object-oriented language such as Java.
 * The basics of OOP are enabled in the SARL scripts. If you need more complex or more
 * complete support of the OOP, you should use a dedicated language, such as Java,
 * [Xtend](https://eclipse.org/xtend/), or [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).
