SARLJvmModelInferrer_0=\nConstruct an event. The source of the event is unknown.\n
SARLJvmModelInferrer_1=\nConstruct an event.\n@param {0} - address of the agent that is emitting this event.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_2=Returns a String representation of the {0} event''s attributes only.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_3=\nConstruct a skill.\n@param {0} - agent that is owning this skill.\n
SARLJvmModelInferrer_4=\nConstruct a skill. The owning agent is unknown.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_5=\nConstruct a behavior.\n@param {0} - reference to the agent that is owning this behavior.\n
SARLJvmModelInferrer_6=\nConstruct an agent.\n@param {0} - identifier of the parent. It is the identifer of the parent agent and the enclosing contect, at the same time.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_7=\nConstruct an agent.\n@param {0} - identifier of the parent. It is the identifer of the parent agent and the enclosing contect, at the same time.\n@param {1} - identifier of the agent. If <code>null</code> the agent identifier will be computed randomly.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_8=Invalid generation of the default-valued formal parameters
SARLJvmModelInferrer_9=\nEnsures that the behavior {0} is called only when the guard {1} is valid.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_10=Unable to resolve the event for a behavior unit.
SARLJvmModelInferrer_11=Default value for the parameter {0}
